        title: 'Introduction to Cognitive Distortions',
        subtitle: 'How your thoughts can mislead you',
        content: '''
Your thoughts are not always accurate. In fact, your mind can lie to you, especially in ways that make recovery harder.

These inaccurate thoughts are called cognitive distortions, and learning to recognize them is a game-changer.

What Are Cognitive Distortions?
Cognitive distortions are patterns of thinking that are exaggerated, irrational, or simply untrue. They feel real in the moment, but they don't reflect reality.

Examples:
• "I'll never be able to stay sober" (fortune telling)
• "Everyone thinks I'm a failure" (mind reading)
• "If I slip once, I've failed completely" (all-or-nothing thinking)

How Thoughts Influence Behavior:
Your thoughts create emotions, and emotions drive behavior. If you think "I can't handle this," you'll feel hopeless, and you're more likely to use substances to cope.

But if you can challenge that thought—"This is hard, but I've handled hard things before"—you change the emotion and the behavior.

The Goal:
You don't need to eliminate negative thoughts. You need to recognize when they're distorted and choose not to believe them.

        title: 'All-or-Nothing Thinking',
        subtitle: 'The danger of black and white',
        content: '''
All-or-nothing thinking is seeing things in extremes with no middle ground. You're either perfect or a failure. You're either sober or you've completely lost.

This type of thinking is dangerous in recovery because it leaves no room for progress.

What It Looks Like:
• "If I slip once, I've ruined everything"
• "I'm either completely in control or completely out of control"
• "If I'm not perfect, I'm worthless"

The Problem:
Recovery is messy. Progress is not linear. If you believe that one mistake means total failure, you're more likely to give up when challenges arise.

All-or-nothing thinking turns a slip into a full relapse. It turns a bad day into proof that you can't succeed.

The Reality:
Recovery exists in the gray area. You can have setbacks and still be moving forward. You can make mistakes and still be worthy of compassion.

Challenging All-or-Nothing Thinking:
Instead of "I failed," try "I had a setback, and I can learn from it."
Instead of "I'm either sober or not," try "Recovery is a process with ups and downs."

Perfection is not the goal. Progress is.

        title: 'Catastrophizing and Mind Reading',
        subtitle: 'When you assume the worst',
        content: '''
Catastrophizing means assuming the worst possible outcome will happen. Mind reading means believing you know what others are thinking—usually something negative.

Both distortions fuel anxiety and make recovery feel impossible.

Catastrophizing:
This is when you imagine the worst-case scenario and treat it as inevitable.

Examples:
• "If I go to that party, I'll definitely relapse"
• "If I tell my family about my recovery, they'll reject me"
• "One craving means I'm going to lose everything"

The problem: You can't predict the future. Treating worst-case scenarios as certainties creates unnecessary fear.

Mind Reading:
This is when you assume you know what others are thinking about you—and it's usually negative.

Examples:
• "Everyone at the meeting thinks I'm pathetic"
• "My boss knows I'm in recovery and thinks less of me"
• "My family will never forgive me"

The problem: You don't actually know what others think. You're projecting your own fears onto them.

Challenging These Distortions:
Ask yourself: "What evidence do I have for this belief?"
Consider: "What's a more realistic outcome?"
Remember: You can't read minds, and the future isn't written yet.

        title: 'Should Statements and Labeling',
        subtitle: 'The language of self-criticism',
        content: '''
"Should" statements and labeling are two of the most harmful cognitive distortions because they attack your sense of self.

Should Statements:
These are rigid rules you impose on yourself or others.

Examples:
• "I should be further along in recovery by now"
• "I should be able to handle stress without struggling"
• "I shouldn't need help"

The problem: "Should" statements create guilt and shame. They ignore reality and set impossible standards.

Better alternative: Replace "should" with "I choose" or "I want."
• "I choose to work on my recovery at my own pace"
• "I want to develop better coping skills"

Labeling:
This is when you define yourself by a mistake or characteristic.

Examples:
• "I'm an addict" (instead of "I have an addiction")
• "I'm a failure" (instead of "I made a mistake")
• "I'm broken" (instead of "I'm healing")

The problem: Labels become identity. When you label yourself negatively, you reinforce that belief.

Better alternative: Separate your behavior from your identity.
• "I struggled today" (not "I'm weak")
• "I made a poor choice" (not "I'm a bad person")

You are not your mistakes. You are not your diagnosis. You are a person in recovery, learning and growing.

        title: 'Reframing Negative Thoughts',
        subtitle: 'Building balanced thinking',
        content: '''
Now that you've learned about cognitive distortions, it's time to practice reframing—replacing distorted thoughts with balanced, realistic ones.

This doesn't mean replacing negative thoughts with fake positivity. It means finding the truth in the middle.

The Thought Challenge Process:
1. Notice the thought: "I'll never stay sober"
2. Identify the distortion: All-or-nothing thinking, fortune telling
3. Look for evidence: Have I stayed sober before? Have I made progress?
4. Reframe: "Recovery is hard, but I've stayed sober today, and I can do it again tomorrow"

Examples of Reframing:
• Distorted: "I'm a failure because I had a craving"
  Balanced: "Having a craving doesn't mean I've failed. It means I'm human."

• Distorted: "Everyone at the meeting judged me"
  Balanced: "I don't know what they thought. Most people are focused on their own recovery."

• Distorted: "If I slip once, I've ruined everything"
  Balanced: "A slip is a setback, not the end. I can learn from it and keep going."

Practice Makes Progress:
The more you challenge distorted thoughts, the weaker they become. Your brain starts to default to balanced thinking instead of automatic negativity.

Use the CBT Thought Challenge worksheet in the Tools section to practice this skill regularly.
