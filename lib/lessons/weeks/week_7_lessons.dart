        title: 'Trust and Rebuilding',
        subtitle: 'Earning trust through consistency',
        content: '''
Addiction breaks trust. You may have lied, manipulated, stolen, or disappeared. The people in your life have been hurt.

Rebuilding trust is a slow process that requires consistency, not promises.

Why Trust Was Broken:
Addiction changes behavior. You likely did things you're not proud of. You broke promises. You chose substances over people.

This wasn't because you're a bad person. It was because addiction had control.

But that doesn't erase the pain you caused.

How Trust Is Rebuilt:
Trust is not rebuilt with words. It's rebuilt with actions over time.

• Show up consistently
• Do what you say you'll do
• Be honest, even when it's uncomfortable
• Take accountability without excuses
• Be patient with others' hurt and skepticism

You can't rush this process. Trust takes time to rebuild because it took time to destroy.

The people in your life need to see consistent change before they can believe in your recovery.

Managing Your Expectations:
Not everyone will give you another chance. Some relationships may not be salvageable, and that's painful but sometimes necessary.

Focus on the relationships that are worth rebuilding and accept that some doors may stay closed.

You can't control how others respond. You can only control your own actions.

        title: 'Healthy Boundaries',
        subtitle: 'Protecting yourself and others',
        content: '''
Boundaries are limits you set to protect your wellbeing. They define what you will and won't accept in relationships.

Many people in recovery struggle with boundaries because they never learned to set them.

What Are Boundaries?
Boundaries are not walls. They're not about shutting people out. They're about creating space for healthy relationships.

Examples of boundaries:
• "I can't be around people who are using"
• "I need you to respect my recovery by not offering me substances"
• "I won't tolerate yelling or name-calling"
• "I need time alone to recharge"

Why Boundaries Matter in Recovery:
Without boundaries, you're vulnerable to:
• Being pressured to use
• Taking on others' problems and burning out
• Staying in toxic relationships that threaten your sobriety
• Losing yourself in people-pleasing

Saying No Without Guilt:
Many people feel guilty setting boundaries. They worry about being selfish or hurting others.

But protecting your recovery is not selfish. It's survival.

You cannot set yourself on fire to keep others warm.

How to Set a Boundary:
1. Be clear and direct
2. Don't over-explain or apologize
3. Follow through with consequences if the boundary is violated
4. Don't negotiate boundaries that are non-negotiable

Example: "I can't go to that party because there will be drinking. I hope you understand, but I won't be there."

        title: 'Communication Skills',
        subtitle: 'Expressing yourself clearly and kindly',
        content: '''
Healthy communication is essential for maintaining relationships and resolving conflict without turning to substances.

Many people in recovery never learned how to communicate effectively.

"I" Statements:
"I" statements express your feelings and needs without blaming others.

Instead of: "You never listen to me!"
Try: "I feel unheard when I'm interrupted."

Instead of: "You're making me stressed!"
Try: "I feel stressed when plans change last minute."

"I" statements reduce defensiveness and open the door to productive conversation.

Active Listening:
This means truly hearing what someone is saying, not just waiting for your turn to talk.

• Make eye contact
• Nod and show you're engaged
• Reflect back what you heard ("It sounds like you're feeling...")
• Ask clarifying questions
• Don't interrupt or offer unsolicited advice

Assertive Communication:
Assertiveness is the balance between passive (avoiding conflict) and aggressive (attacking others).

Assertive communication is:
• Clear and direct
• Respectful of yourself and others
• Honest without being harsh
• Firm but kind

Example: "I understand you're upset, but I won't continue this conversation if you're yelling. Let's talk when we've both calmed down."

Conflict Is Not the Enemy:
Healthy relationships have conflict. The goal is not to avoid conflict but to navigate it without destruction.

        title: 'Toxic Relationships',
        subtitle: 'Recognizing when to walk away',
        content: '''
Not all relationships are worth saving. Some are actively harmful to your recovery.

Learning to recognize toxic relationships—and having the courage to walk away—is critical.

What Makes a Relationship Toxic?
• They pressure you to use or undermine your recovery
• They're consistently dishonest or manipulative
• They take without giving (one-sided)
• They're verbally, emotionally, or physically abusive
• They refuse to respect your boundaries
• Being around them makes you feel worse about yourself

Enabling vs. Supporting:
Enabling means protecting someone from the consequences of their actions. It keeps them stuck.

Supporting means holding someone accountable while offering love and encouragement.

If someone in your life enables your substance use or makes excuses for you, they're part of the problem, even if they love you.

Codependency:
This is when your sense of self becomes tangled up in another person. You lose yourself trying to fix or save them.

Signs of codependency:
• Putting others' needs above your own, always
• Feeling responsible for others' feelings
• Difficulty saying no
• Defining yourself by your relationships
• Fear of being alone

Codependent relationships often feel intense and important, but they're not healthy.

When to Distance or Leave:
If a relationship consistently threatens your sobriety, you need to create distance or end it entirely.

This is incredibly hard, especially if it's family or a long-term relationship. But your life depends on it.

You can love someone and still choose not to have them in your life.

        title: 'Building Your Support Network',
        subtitle: 'You can\'t do this alone',
        content: '''
Recovery cannot happen in isolation. You need a support network—people who understand, encourage, and hold you accountable.

Building this network is one of the most important things you can do.

Who Should Be in Your Support Network?
• People who support your recovery (not your substance use)
• People who are honest with you, even when it's hard
• People who have walked a similar path
• People who are available and reliable
• People who respect your boundaries

Types of Support:
Emotional support: Someone who listens without judgment
Practical support: Someone who helps with daily tasks or logistics
Accountability: Someone who checks in and calls you out
Mentorship: Someone further along who offers guidance
Social connection: Someone to do sober activities with

Where to Find Support:
• 12-step meetings (AA, NA, etc.)
• SMART Recovery or other evidence-based groups
• Faith communities
• Therapy or counseling
• Sober living communities
• Online recovery forums
• Recovery apps and check-in groups

Asking for Help:
Many people struggle to ask for help because they feel ashamed or weak.

But asking for help is a sign of strength. It means you're serious about recovery.

You don't have to do this alone. You were never meant to.

Reciprocal Support:
As you heal, you'll also have the opportunity to support others. Helping others in recovery strengthens your own.

Give back when you're ready. Share your story. Offer hope to someone who's where you once were.
