        title: 'Who Am I Without Substances?',
        subtitle: 'Rediscovering yourself',
        content: '''
One of the most disorienting parts of early recovery is the question: "Who am I without substances?"

If substances defined your identity for years, recovery can feel like an identity crisis.

The Loss of Identity:
Substance use often becomes central to who you are. Your social life, your routines, your sense of self—all tied to using.

When you stop, there's a void. You might feel like a stranger to yourself.

This is normal. And it's temporary.

Who You Were Before:
Think back to who you were before substances took over. What did you enjoy? What were you good at? What mattered to you?

Some of those parts of yourself are still there, waiting to be rediscovered.

Who You're Becoming:
Recovery is not about returning to who you were. It's about becoming who you're meant to be.

You're not the same person you were before. You've been through things. You've grown. You have wisdom now that you didn't have before.

The Exploration Phase:
Give yourself permission to try things. You don't have to have it all figured out.

Try new hobbies. Meet new people. Explore interests you've always been curious about.

Some things will stick. Some won't. That's okay.

You're rediscovering and recreating yourself. That's the work of recovery.

        title: 'Values Clarification',
        subtitle: 'What matters most to you',
        content: '''
Values are the principles that guide your life. They're what matter most to you when you strip away everything else.

Living in alignment with your values creates meaning and direction in recovery.

What Are Values?
Values are not goals. Goals are things you achieve. Values are directions you move toward.

Examples:
• Connection (not "make 5 friends" but "move toward connection")
• Honesty (not "never lie again" but "move toward truthfulness")
• Growth (not "get a degree" but "move toward learning")
• Health (not "lose 20 pounds" but "move toward wellbeing")

Common Values in Recovery:
• Honesty and integrity
• Family and relationships
• Health and self-care
• Personal growth
• Service and helping others
• Creativity and self-expression
• Stability and safety
• Freedom and independence

Identifying Your Values:
Ask yourself:
• What matters most to me?
• What kind of person do I want to be?
• What do I want to be remembered for?
• When I'm at my best, what am I doing?

Living Aligned with Values:
When your actions match your values, you feel grounded and purposeful.

When they don't, you feel disconnected and lost.

Recovery is an opportunity to realign your life with what truly matters to you.

        title: 'Setting Meaningful Goals',
        subtitle: 'Creating a future worth working toward',
        content: '''
Goals give you something to work toward. They create hope and direction.

In recovery, meaningful goals keep you moving forward instead of staying stuck in the past.

SMART Goals:
Effective goals are:
• Specific: Clear and well-defined
• Measurable: You can track progress
• Achievable: Realistic given your resources
• Relevant: Aligned with your values
• Time-bound: Has a deadline

Examples:
Not SMART: "Get healthier"
SMART: "Exercise 3 times per week for 30 minutes for the next month"

Not SMART: "Fix my relationships"
SMART: "Call my sister once a week to rebuild our connection"

Short-Term vs. Long-Term Goals:
Short-term (1-3 months): Build new habits, stabilize recovery, address immediate needs
Long-term (6 months - 1 year+): Career changes, education, major life decisions

Start with short-term goals. Build momentum. Then tackle bigger goals.

Recovery-Focused Goals:
• Attend 90 meetings in 90 days
• Complete this 12-week program
• Find a therapist and attend weekly sessions
• Build a support network of 5 people
• Stay sober for 6 months

Life-Focused Goals:
• Get a job or advance in your career
• Repair a relationship
• Pursue a hobby or passion
• Improve physical health
• Financial stability

Balance both. Recovery creates the foundation for the life you want to build.

        title: 'Finding Purpose',
        subtitle: 'Why you\'re here',
        content: '''
Purpose is the "why" behind your life. It's what gives your existence meaning beyond just getting through the day.

Many people in recovery struggle with purpose because substances filled that void for so long.

What Is Purpose?
Purpose is not a job title or a single achievement. It's a sense that your life matters—that you're here for a reason.

Purpose can be:
• Raising children
• Creating art or beauty
• Helping others
• Making a difference in your community
• Learning and growing
• Being a good friend or partner
• Pursuing a passion

Your purpose doesn't have to be grand. It just has to be meaningful to you.

The Search for Meaning:
Viktor Frankl, a Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist, wrote that humans can endure almost anything if they have a reason to live.

In recovery, purpose is what keeps you going when things get hard.

Finding Your Purpose:
Ask yourself:
• What would I do if I knew I couldn't fail?
• What breaks my heart or makes me angry about the world?
• What do people come to me for help with?
• What activities make me lose track of time?
• If I had one year to live, how would I spend it?

Your answers point toward your purpose.

Purpose Evolves:
You don't have to find your purpose once and for all. It can change as you grow.

Right now, your purpose might simply be to stay sober and heal. That's enough.

        title: 'Legacy and Contribution',
        subtitle: 'What you leave behind',
        content: '''
Legacy is not just what you leave when you die. It's what you create every day through your actions, relationships, and choices.

In recovery, you have the opportunity to create a legacy you're proud of.

What Is Legacy?
Legacy is the impact you have on the world and the people around you.

It's:
• The way you treat others
• The values you live by
• The changes you make
• The stories people tell about you
• The difference you make, big or small

Your legacy is being written right now.

Rewriting Your Story:
Addiction may have been a chapter of your story, but it doesn't have to define the whole book.

Recovery gives you the chance to write a new chapter—one of growth, healing, and contribution.

Ways to Contribute:
You don't have to change the world. Small contributions matter.

• Be a good friend or family member
• Volunteer in your community
• Share your recovery story to give others hope
• Mentor someone who's struggling
• Create something meaningful (art, writing, music)
• Show up with kindness and integrity

The Ripple Effect:
You never know how your actions impact others. A kind word, a listening ear, a shared experience—these ripple outward.

Your recovery alone is a contribution. It shows others that change is possible.

Living with Intention:
Ask yourself daily: "How do I want to show up today?"

Then live accordingly.

That's how you build a legacy worth leaving.
