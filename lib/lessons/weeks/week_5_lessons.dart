        title: 'Trauma\'s Role in Addiction',
        subtitle: 'Understanding the connection',
        content: '''
Many people with substance use disorders have experienced trauma. Understanding this connection is crucial for healing.

Trauma is not just about what happened to you—it's about how those experiences affected your nervous system and sense of safety.

What Is Trauma?
Trauma is any experience that overwhelms your ability to cope. It can be a single event (accident, assault, loss) or chronic experiences (abuse, neglect, instability).

Not everyone who experiences a traumatic event develops trauma symptoms, but many do.

The Trauma-Addiction Link:
Substances are often used to manage the symptoms of unprocessed trauma:
• Intrusive memories and flashbacks
• Hypervigilance and anxiety
• Emotional numbness
• Sleep disturbances
• Difficulty trusting others

Using substances to cope with trauma makes sense—it's a survival strategy. But over time, it creates new problems without solving the original pain.

Common Trauma Responses:
Fight (anger, aggression)
Flight (avoidance, running away)
Freeze (shutdown, dissociation)
Fawn (people-pleasing, losing yourself)

All of these are normal responses to abnormal experiences.

Healing Is Possible:
You don't have to stay stuck in trauma. With support, therapy, and time, you can process what happened and reclaim your life.

Recovery from addiction often requires addressing underlying trauma.

        title: 'Hypervigilance and Numbing',
        subtitle: 'The pendulum of trauma responses',
        content: '''
Trauma survivors often swing between two extremes: hypervigilance (on high alert) and numbing (shutting down emotionally).

Understanding this pendulum helps you recognize when you're dysregulated.

Hypervigilance:
This is when your nervous system is stuck in survival mode. You're constantly scanning for danger, even when you're safe.

Signs of hypervigilance:
• Feeling on edge or jumpy
• Difficulty relaxing
• Overreacting to small stressors
• Trouble sleeping
• Physical tension

Substances were often used to calm this state—to turn off the constant alertness.

Emotional Numbing:
This is the opposite: shutting down completely to avoid overwhelming feelings.

Signs of numbing:
• Feeling disconnected from yourself or others
• Difficulty experiencing joy or pleasure
• Going through the motions
• Emotional flatness
• Dissociation

Substances were also used to maintain this numbness—to avoid feeling anything at all.

The Pendulum:
Many trauma survivors swing between these two states. You're either overwhelmed by intensity or shut down completely. There's no middle ground.

Recovery means finding the middle—a place where you can feel without being overwhelmed and be alert without being panicked.

This is called your "window of tolerance."

        title: 'Safe Processing Strategies',
        subtitle: 'Healing trauma at your own pace',
        content: '''
Trauma healing is not about forcing yourself to relive painful experiences. It's about processing them safely, at a pace you can tolerate.

This requires support and often professional help.

The Window of Tolerance:
Imagine a window—inside the window, you can think clearly, feel emotions, and function. Outside the window, you're either overwhelmed (hyperarousal) or shut down (hypoarousal).

Trauma therapy helps you stay inside your window while gradually processing difficult memories.

When to Seek Professional Help:
If you're experiencing:
• Intrusive flashbacks or nightmares
• Severe anxiety or panic attacks
• Dissociation or feeling disconnected from reality
• Suicidal thoughts
• Inability to function in daily life

You need trauma-informed therapy. This is not something you should do alone.

Types of Trauma Therapy:
• EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)
• CPT (Cognitive Processing Therapy)
• PE (Prolonged Exposure)
• Somatic Experiencing
• Trauma-Focused CBT

All of these approaches are evidence-based and effective.

You Don't Have to Do This Alone:
Healing trauma is hard work. You need a trained professional who understands trauma and recovery.

This app provides education and support, but it's not a replacement for therapy if you've experienced significant trauma.

        title: 'Grounding Techniques',
        subtitle: 'Coming back to the present',
        content: '''
Grounding techniques help you return to the present moment when you're overwhelmed by trauma memories, flashbacks, or intense emotions.

These are essential tools for trauma survivors in recovery.

Why Grounding Works:
Trauma pulls you into the past. Your body reacts as if the traumatic event is happening now.

Grounding reminds your nervous system: "I am here, now. I am safe."

Sensory Grounding (5-4-3-2-1):
This uses your five senses to anchor you in the present.
• 5 things you can see
• 4 things you can touch
• 3 things you can hear
• 2 things you can smell
• 1 thing you can taste

Physical Grounding:
• Feel your feet on the floor
• Press your hands together
• Hold ice or splash cold water on your face
• Stretch or move your body
• Touch something textured (soft blanket, rough stone)

Mental Grounding:
• Name objects in the room
• Count backward from 100 by 7s
• Recite something you've memorized
• Describe your surroundings in detail

Emotional Grounding:
• Say out loud: "I am [name]. I am [age]. I am in [location]. I am safe."
• Remind yourself: "That was then. This is now."

Practice These When You're Calm:
Don't wait for a crisis to learn grounding. Practice when you're regulated so the techniques are automatic when you need them.

        title: 'Trauma-Informed Recovery',
        subtitle: 'Healing at your own pace',
        content: '''
Trauma-informed recovery recognizes that healing is not linear and that you need to go at your own pace.

There is no timeline for healing. There is no "right way" to recover.

What Trauma-Informed Means:
• Safety first: You need to feel safe before you can heal
• Choice and control: You decide what you're ready for
• Collaboration: You work with support, not under someone's control
• Trustworthiness: Your support system is consistent and reliable
• Empowerment: You are the expert on your own experience

Healing Is Not Forgetting:
Trauma-informed recovery is not about erasing what happened. It's about integrating the experience so it no longer controls you.

You will always remember what happened. But the memory won't always have the same power over you.

Self-Compassion in Trauma Recovery:
Trauma survivors often blame themselves for what happened or for struggling to heal.

Self-compassion means understanding that:
• What happened to you was not your fault
• Your survival strategies made sense
• Healing takes as long as it takes
• You are worthy of care and safety

Be Patient with Yourself:
Trauma healing is slow, non-linear work. You will have setbacks. You will have days where you feel like you're back at the beginning.

That's normal. That's part of healing.

Keep showing up for yourself, even on the hard days.
