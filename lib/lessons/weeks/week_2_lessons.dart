        title: 'Understanding Triggers',
        subtitle: 'Knowing what sets off cravings',
        content: '''
Triggers are anything that activates a craving or urge to use substances. They can be people, places, things, emotions, or situations.

Understanding your triggers is essential because you can't avoid what you don't recognize.

Internal vs. External Triggers:
External triggers are things outside of you—a location, a person, a smell, a song. These are often easier to identify and sometimes easier to avoid.

Internal triggers are feelings, thoughts, or physical sensations—stress, boredom, loneliness, physical pain. These are harder to avoid because they come from within.

The Power of Recognition:
Once you know your triggers, you have options. You can avoid some, prepare for others, and develop coping strategies for those you can't escape.

Triggers are not the enemy. They're information. They tell you where you're vulnerable and where you need support.

Your triggers are unique to your story. What triggers someone else might not affect you, and vice versa. This is about your journey, not anyone else's.

        title: 'The Craving Cycle',
        subtitle: 'How cravings build and fade',
        content: '''
Cravings are not permanent. They build, peak, and fade like waves in the ocean.

Understanding this cycle changes everything.

The Wave Metaphor:
Imagine standing in the ocean as a wave approaches. You have two choices: run away in panic, or stand your ground and let it wash over you.

Cravings work the same way. They rise, crest, and fall—usually within 15 to 30 minutes.

The Build:
A craving starts small. Maybe it's a fleeting thought or a mild discomfort. If you focus on it, it grows. Your mind starts bargaining: "Just this once," or "I deserve it."

The Peak:
At its peak, a craving feels unbearable. Your body is tense. Your mind is obsessed. This is the moment most people give in.

The Fade:
But if you wait—if you surf the urge instead of acting on it—the craving will fade. It always does.

The more you practice riding out cravings, the weaker they become over time.

        title: 'Managing Internal Triggers',
        subtitle: 'When emotions drive cravings',
        content: '''
Internal triggers—emotions, thoughts, and physical sensations—are often the hardest to manage because you can't simply avoid them.

You will feel stressed. You will feel bored. You will feel lonely. The question is: what will you do when those feelings arise?

HALT: The Big Four Internal Triggers:
Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired. These four states make you vulnerable to cravings.

When you're physically depleted or emotionally raw, your ability to resist urges weakens. Recognizing HALT moments helps you intervene before a craving becomes unmanageable.

Stress and Anxiety:
Stress is one of the most common relapse triggers. Substances were often used to numb stress, so when stress returns, so does the urge to escape.

Recovery means learning to tolerate discomfort without numbing it.

Practical Strategies:
• Name the emotion: "I'm feeling anxious" (not "I need to use")
• Ask: "What does this feeling need?" (rest, connection, movement, food?)
• Use a coping skill before the craving peaks
• Reach out to someone in your support network

        subtitle: 'People, places, and things',
        content: '''
External triggers are easier to identify than internal ones, but that doesn't always make them easier to manage.

You can't always avoid people, places, and things that remind you of substance use. But you can create strategies to protect yourself.

People:
Some people in your life are tied to your substance use. Being around them might trigger cravings or pressure to use.

You may need to distance yourself from certain people, at least temporarily. This isn't about blame—it's about survival.

Places:
Certain locations hold powerful associations. A bar, a friend's house, even a specific street corner can trigger intense cravings.

Whenever possible, avoid high-risk places, especially early in recovery.

Things:
Objects, smells, songs, and even times of day can trigger cravings. The smell of alcohol, the sight of paraphernalia, a song you used to listen to while using—all of these carry emotional weight.

Creating Trigger-Free Zones:
Your home should be a safe space. Remove anything associated with substance use. Rearrange your space. Create new routines.

You're building a new life. Your environment should reflect that.

        title: 'Urge Surfing in Depth',
        subtitle: 'The skill that changes everything',
        content: '''
Urge surfing is the practice of riding out a craving without acting on it.

It's one of the most powerful tools in recovery.

The Science Behind It:
Every time you resist a craving, you weaken the neural pathways that drive it. Every time you give in, you strengthen them.

Urge surfing is like building a muscle. The more you practice, the stronger you get.

How to Surf an Urge:
1. Notice the craving without judgment ("I'm having a craving")
2. Observe where you feel it in your body (chest, stomach, hands)
3. Breathe slowly and deeply
4. Remind yourself: "This will pass"
5. Use a distraction or grounding technique
6. Wait it out—usually 15-30 minutes

What Happens Over Time:
The first few times you surf an urge, it feels impossible. But each time you succeed, the next craving becomes a little easier.

Eventually, cravings lose their power. They become background noise instead of a roaring wave.

You don't have to eliminate cravings to be successful in recovery. You just have to stop acting on them.
